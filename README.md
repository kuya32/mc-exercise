Things we learned:

WORK ON BRANCHES! DO not push to master without working on a branch. 

We learned how to merge from the terminal.

Pull from the master before starting work. 

ACP often! Avoid long periods of time between pushing from master. 
- if the work on a branch is useful to others, be sure to push.

Make sure branch protections are on and that all collaborators have access. Make these at the time of repo creation.

If everyone is working on different branches, the work should be compartmentalized. 

Make sure to communicate with team members.
